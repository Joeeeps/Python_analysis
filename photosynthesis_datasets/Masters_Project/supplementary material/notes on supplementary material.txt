The supplementary material is split into three sections:

S1- All_accessions_with_donor.csv
This is just a table of all expression data collected in our study and grouped using R. 
Included so the data can be looked at without running the whole R script (although as I filtered various dataframes as needed, it's probably better to view the data on R itself)

S2- final r stats 070622
This is the final version of my R script, running line by line works perfectly. As there is a lot of filtering, repeating
certain segments of the script after fully running the script might come up with an error.
This can be fixed if the script is re-ran from the start of the appropriate segment for that data-frame (but its simpler to just re-run the whole script
up to the line of code you want to run). 

S3- bash scripts
This is scripts I used to automate runs for fastqc, trimmomatic and eXpress.
